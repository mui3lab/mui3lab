# MUI3 Laboratory

## Led by Dr. Carl Herickhoff in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Memphis, our group develops novel transducers and approaches to ultrasound imaging (and therapy) for many clinical applications.  We are continually: building out our lab and research team, developing collaborations and partnerships, and creating and translating new medical ultrasound technologies to advance the field and improve human health.
